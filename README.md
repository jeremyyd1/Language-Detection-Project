# Language Detection Model Using NB

# Background
This project is a portfolio project based on this tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-efficient-language-detection-model-using-naive-bayes-85d02b51cfbd
I decided to put my own spin on the project by using different languages as well as asking for user input to predict the language based on their input. 

I created:
-The GUI using Tkinter
-All of the defined functions and their contents

The part adapted from the tutorial is the main training and fitting of the machine learning model that is used to recognize the language. 

My goal with this project is to demonstrate not only basic knowledge of Python such as data structures, functions and while loops, but to showcase my understanding of data preprocessing and regex, as well as the principles of Machine Learning.

# Comments
I used a Python file rather than a .txt to store the Spanish and Portuguese text data as string as my computer wasn't allowing me to read from .txt files due to unchangeable permission issues.
