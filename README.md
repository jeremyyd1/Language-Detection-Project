# Portfolio-Projects

This project is a portfolio project based on this tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-efficient-language-detection-model-using-naive-bayes-85d02b51cfbd

I decided to put my own spin on the project by using different languages as well as asking for user input to predict the language based on their input.
